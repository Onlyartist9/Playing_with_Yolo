### How I found out about this model.
So imagine you're me. You want to test some newfound AI knowledge beyond the mere textbook,or Kaggle contest. 
You become familiar with allll and I mean nearly all... ok some of the popular/modern Computer Vision models whether it be SAM(Segment Anything Model),
or some other framework like OpenCV. Then you decide to freelance to put your skills to test. 

Bro all I saw are people asking for help on their YOLO models. 

Wtf is a YOLO model?

The above sentence is why I created this repo. Kind of wanted an understanding of the model and what its capabilities are.

To run this demo locally

```
 1. Clone this repo.
 2. Navigate to this repo in a shell of your choice.
 3. pip install -r requirements.txt
 2. streamlit run Playing_with_yolo.py
```
Now there are a few technicalities depending on what distribution/OS you are running. If you're using windows, locate the comment
regarding fonts in the for loop of the Playing_with_yolo.py file and handle the comments as directed. If you use a Linux based distro you should be good to go.

You can also play with the model [here](https://onlyartist9-playing-with-yolo-playing-with-yolo-ikg2jm.streamlit.app/).
